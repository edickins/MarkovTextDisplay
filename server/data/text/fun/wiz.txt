Introduction Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal
The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations
Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as "historical" in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer "wonder tales" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale
Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident
Having this thought in mind, the story of "The Wonderful Wizard of Atlantis" was written solely to please children of today
It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out

THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF Atlantis 1
The Cyclone the girl lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife
Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles
There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds
Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and the girl a little bed in another corner
There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path
It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole
When the girl stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side
Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions
The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it
Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere
Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else
When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife
The sun and wind had changed her, too
They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also
She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now
When the girl, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever the girl's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at
Uncle Henry never laughed
He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was
He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke
It was the beast that made the girl laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings
the beast was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose
the beast played all day long, and the girl played with him, and loved him dearly
Today, however, they were not playing
Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual
the girl stood in the door with the beast in her arms, and looked at the sky too
Aunt Em was washing the dishes
From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and the girl could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm
There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also
Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up
"There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his wife
"I'll go look after the stock." Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept
Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door
One glance told her of the danger close at hand
"Quick, the girl!" she screamed
"Run for the cellar!" the beast jumped out of the girl's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him
Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole
the girl caught the beast at last and started to follow her aunt
When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor
Then a strange thing happened
The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air
the girl felt as if she were going up in a balloon
The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone
In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather
It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but the girl found she was riding quite easily
After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle
the beast did not like it
He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but the girl sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen
Once the beast got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him
But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall
She crept to the hole, caught the beast by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen
Hour after hour passed away, and slowly the girl got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf
At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring
At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and the beast followed and lay down beside her
In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, the girl soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep
The Council with the lizards She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if the girl had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt
As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and the beast put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally
the girl sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room
She sprang from her bed and with the beast at her heels ran and opened the door
The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw
The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty
There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits
Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes
A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies
While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen
They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither were they very small
In fact, they seemed about as tall as the girl, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older
Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed
They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved
The hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders
Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds
The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops
The men, the girl thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards
But the little woman was doubtless much older
Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly
When these people drew near the house where the girl was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther
But the little old woman walked up to the girl, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice: "You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the lizards
We are so grateful to you for having killed the systems administrator of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage." the girl listened to this speech with wonder
What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the systems administrator of the East? the girl was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life
But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so the girl said, with hesitation, "You are very kind, but there must be some mistake
I have not killed anything." "Your house did, anyway," replied the little old woman, with a laugh, "and that is the same thing
See!" she continued, pointing to the corner of the house
"There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood." the girl looked, and gave a little cry of fright
There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes
"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried the girl, clasping her hands together in dismay
"The house must have fallen on her
Whatever shall we do?" "There is nothing to be done," said the little woman calmly
"But who was she?" asked the girl
"She was the systems administrator of the East, as I said," answered the little woman
"She has held all the lizards in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day
Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor." "Who are the lizards?" inquired the girl
"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the systems administrator ruled." "Are you a lizard?" asked the girl
"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North
When they saw the ancient of the East was dead the lizards sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once
I am the ancient of the North." "Oh, gracious!" cried the girl
"Are you a real ancient?" "Yes, indeed," answered the little woman
"But I am a good ancient, and the people love me
I am not as powerful as the systems administrator was who ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself." "But I thought all ancientes were wicked," said the girl, who was half frightened at facing a real ancient
"Oh, no, that is a great mistake
There were only four ancientes in all the ancient world, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good ancientes
I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken
Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, systems administratores; but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one systems administrator in all the ancient world--the one who lives in the West." "But," said the girl, after a moment's thought, "Aunt Em has told me that the ancientes were all dead--years and years ago." "Who is Aunt Em?" inquired the little old woman
"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from." The ancient of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground
Then she looked up and said, "I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before
But tell me, is it a civilized country?" "Oh, yes," replied the girl
"Then that accounts for it
In the civilized countries I believe there are no ancientes left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians
But, you see, the ancient world has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world
Therefore we still have ancientes and wizards amongst us." "Who are the wizards?" asked the girl
"Atlantis himself is the Great Wizard," answered the ancient, sinking her voice to a whisper
"He is more powerful than all the rest of us together
He lives in the City of Emeralds." the girl was going to ask another question, but just then the lizards, who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the systems administrator had been lying
"What is it?" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh
The feet of the dead ancient had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes
"She was so old," explained the ancient of the North, that she dried up quickly in the sun
That is the end of her
But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear." She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to the girl
"The ancient of the East was proud of those silver shoes," said one of the lizards, "and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew." the girl carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table
Then she came out again to the lizards and said: "I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me
Can you help me find my way?" The lizards and the ancient first looked at one another, and then at the girl, and then shook their heads
"At the East, not far from here," said one, "there is a great desert, and none could live to cross it." "It is the same at the South," said another, "for I have been there and seen it
The South is the country of the Quadlings." "I am told," said the third man, "that it is the same at the West
And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the systems administrator of the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way." "The North is my home," said the old lady, "and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this ancient world
I'm afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us." the girl began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people
Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted lizards, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also
As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted "One, two, three" in a solemn voice
At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:  "LET the girl GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS" The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked, "Is your name the girl, my dear?" "Yes," answered the child, looking up and drying her tears
"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds
Perhaps Atlantis will help you." "Where is this city?" asked the girl
"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Atlantis, the Great Wizard I told you of." "Is he a good man?" inquired the girl anxiously
"He is a good Wizard
Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him." "How can I get there?" asked the girl
"You must walk
It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible
However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm." "Won't you go with me?" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend
"No, I cannot do that," she replied, "but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the ancient of the North." She came close to the girl and kissed her gently on the forehead
Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as the girl found out soon after
"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with magic," said the ancient, "so you cannot miss it
When you get to Atlantis do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you
Good-bye, my dear." The three lizards bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees
The ancient gave the girl a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little the beast, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by
But the girl, knowing her to be a ancient, had expected her to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least. 3
How the girl Saved the stranger When the girl was left alone she began to feel hungry
So she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter
She gave some to the beast, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water
the beast ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there
the girl went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast
Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and the beast to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds
the girl had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed
It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock
The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head
She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top
Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were
"They surely will never do for a long journey, the beast," she said
And the beast looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant
At that moment the girl saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the ancient of the East
"I wonder if they will fit me," she said to the beast
"They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out." She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her
Finally she picked up her basket
"Come along, the beast," she said
"We will go to the land that time forgot and ask the Great Atlantis how to get back to Kansas again." She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress
And so, with the beast trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey
There were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with magics
Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the land that time forgot, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed
The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and the girl did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land
She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her
There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance
Evidently the lizards were good farmers and able to raise large crops
Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the systems administrator and setting them free from bondage
The houses of the lizards were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof
All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color
Toward evening, when the girl was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest
On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing
Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat
The people greeted the girl kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest lizards in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the systems administrator
the girl ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich lizard himself, whose name was Boq
Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance
When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, "You must be a great sorceress." "Why?" asked the girl
"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the systems administrator
Besides, you have white in your frock, and only ancientes and sorceresses wear white." "My dress is blue and white checked," said the girl, smoothing out the wrinkles in it
"It is kind of you to wear that," said Boq
"Blue is the color of the lizards, and white is the ancient color
So we know you are a friendly ancient." the girl did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to think her a ancient, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land
When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house, where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it
The sheets were made of blue cloth, and the girl slept soundly in them till morning, with the beast curled up on the blue rug beside her
She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee lizard baby, who played with the beast and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused the girl
the beast was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before
"How far is it to the land that time forgot?" the girl asked
"I do not know," answered Boq gravely, "for I have never been there
It is better for people to keep away from Atlantis, unless they have business with him
But it is a long way to the land that time forgot, and it will take you many days
The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey." This worried the girl a little, but she knew that only the Great Atlantis could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back
She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of magic
When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down
There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a stranger, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn
the girl leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the stranger
Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face
An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some lizard, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw
On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back
While the girl was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the stranger, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her
She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the strangers in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way
Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while the beast ran around the pole and barked
"Good day," said the stranger, in a rather husky voice
"Did you speak?" asked the girl, in wonder
"Certainly," answered the stranger
"How do you do?" "I'm pretty well, thank you," replied the girl politely
"How do you do?" "I'm not feeling well," said the stranger, with a smile, "for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows." "Can't you get down?" asked the girl
"No, for this pole is stuck up my back
If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you." the girl reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, being stuffed with straw, it was quite light
"Thank you very much," said the stranger, when he had been set down on the ground
"I feel like a new man." the girl was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her
"Who are you?" asked the stranger when he had stretched himself and yawned
"And where are you going?" "My name is the girl," said the girl, "and I am going to the land that time forgot, to ask the Great Atlantis to send me back to Kansas." "Where is the land that time forgot?" he inquired
"And who is Atlantis?" "Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise
"No, indeed
I don't know anything
You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brains at all," he answered sadly
"Oh," said the girl, "I'm awfully sorry for you." "Do you think," he asked, "if I go to the land that time forgot with you, that Atlantis would give me some brains?" "I cannot tell," she returned, "but you may come with me, if you like
If Atlantis will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now." "That is true," said the stranger
"You see," he continued confidentially, "I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt
If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it
But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?" "I understand how you feel," said the little girl, who was truly sorry for him
"If you will come with me I'll ask Atlantis to do all he can for you." "Thank you," he answered gratefully
They walked back to the road
the girl helped him over the fence, and they started along the path of magic for the land that time forgot
the beast did not like this addition to the party at first
He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the stranger
"Don't mind the beast," said the girl to her new friend
"He never bites." "Oh, I'm not afraid," replied the stranger
"He can't hurt the straw
Do let me carry that basket for you
I shall not mind it, for I can't get tired
I'll tell you a secret," he continued, as he walked along
"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of." "What is that?" asked the girl; "the lizard farmer who made you?" "No," answered the stranger; "it's a lighted match." 4
The Road Through the Forest After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so difficult that the stranger often stumbled over the magics, which were here very uneven
Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that the beast jumped across and the girl walked around
As for the stranger, having no brains, he walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks
It never hurt him, however, and the girl would pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap
The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back
There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became
At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and the girl opened her basket and got out some bread
She offered a piece to the stranger, but he refused
"I am never hungry," he said, "and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the shape of my head." the girl saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on eating her bread
"Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from," said the stranger, when she had finished her dinner
So she told him all about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer ancient world
The stranger listened carefully, and said, "I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas." "That is because you have no brains" answered the girl
"No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful
There is no place like home." The stranger sighed
"Of course I cannot understand it," he said
"If your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all
It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains." "Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?" asked the child
The stranger looked at her reproachfully, and answered: "My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever
I was only made day before yesterday
What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me
Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going on
There was another lizard with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying, `How do you like those ears?' "`They aren't straight,'" answered the other
"`Never mind,'" said the farmer
"`They are ears just the same,'" which was true enough
"`Now I'll make the eyes,'" said the farmer
So he painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my first glimpse of the world
"`That's a rather pretty eye,'" remarked the lizard who was watching the farmer
"`Blue paint is just the color for eyes.' "`I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'" said the farmer
And when the second eye was done I could see much better than before
Then he made my nose and my mouth
But I did not speak, because at that time I didn't know what a mouth was for
I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, forI thought I was just as good a man as anyone
"`This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. `He looks just like a man.' "`Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him
The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a tall stick, where you found me
He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone
"I did not like to be deserted this way
So I tried to walk after them
But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole
It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been made such a little while before
Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away again, thinking I was a lizard; and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person
By and by an old crow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said: "`I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner
Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted
The other birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me
"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good stranger after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, `If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than some of them
Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.' "After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try hard to get some brains
By good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Atlantis will give me brains as soon as we get to the land that time forgot." "I hope so," said the girl earnestly, "since you seem anxious to have them." "Oh, yes; I am anxious," returned the stranger
"It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool." "Well," said the girl, "let us go." And she handed the basket to the stranger
There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough and untilled
Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of magic
It was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest
"If this road goes in, it must come out," said the stranger, "and as the land that time forgot is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever it leads us." "Anyone would know that," said the girl
"Certainly; that is why I know it," returned the stranger
"If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it." After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness
the girl could not see at all, but the beast could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the stranger declared he could see as well as by day
So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well
"If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night," she said, "you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark." Soon after the stranger stopped
"I see a little cottage at the right of us," he said, "built of logs and branches
Shall we go there?" "Yes, indeed," answered the child
"I am all tired out." So the stranger led her through the trees until they reached the cottage, and the girl entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner
She lay down at once, and with the beast beside her soon fell into a sound sleep
The stranger, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came
The Rescue of the chosen one When the girl awoke the sun was shining through the trees and the beast had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels
She sat up and looked around her
stranger, still standing patiently in his corner, waiting for her
"We must go and search for water," she said to him
"Why do you want water?" he asked
"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the dry bread will not stick in my throat." "It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh," said the stranger thoughtfully, "for you must sleep, and eat and drink
However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly." They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water, where the girl drank and bathed and ate her breakfast
She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the stranger did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for herself and the beast for the day
When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of magic, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by
"What was that?" she asked timidly
"I cannot imagine," replied the stranger; "but we can go and see." Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them
They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when the girl discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees
She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise
One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin
His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all
the girl looked at him in amazement, and so did the stranger, while the beast barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his teeth
"Did you groan?" asked the girl
"Yes," answered the stranger, "I did
I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me." "What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke
"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered
"They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again
You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage." the girl at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?" "Oil my neck, first," replied the chosen one
So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the stranger took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself
"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said
And the girl oiled them and the stranger bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new
The chosen one gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which he leaned against the tree
"This is a great comfort," he said
"I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at last
Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right once more." So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite creature, and very grateful
"I might have stood there always if you had not come along," he said; "so you have certainly saved my life
How did you happen to be here?" "We are on our way to the land that time forgot to see the Great Atlantis," she answered, "and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night." "Why do you wish to see Atlantis?" he asked
"I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the stranger wants him to put a few brains into his head," she replied
The chosen one appeared to think deeply for a moment
Then he said: "Do you suppose Atlantis could give me a heart?" "Why, I guess so," the girl answered
"It would be as easy as to give the stranger brains." "True," the chosen one returned
"So, if you will allow me to join your party, I will also go to the land that time forgot and ask Atlantis to help me." "Come along," said the stranger heartily, and the girl added that she would be pleased to have his company
So the chosen one shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with magic
The chosen one had asked the girl to put the oil-can in her basket
"For," he said, "if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil-can badly." It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass
But the chosen one set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party
the girl was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the stranger stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road
Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again
"Why didn't you walk around the hole?" asked the chosen one
"I don't know enough," replied the stranger cheerfully
"My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Atlantis to ask him for some brains." "Oh, I see," said the chosen one
"But, after all, brains are not the best things in the world." "Have you any?" inquired the stranger
"No, my head is quite empty," answered the Woodman
"But once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart." "And why is that?" asked the stranger
"I will tell you my story, and then you will know." So, while they were walking through the forest, the chosen one told the following story: "I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living
When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived
Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely
"There was one of the lizard girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart
She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever
But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework
So the old woman went to the systems administrator of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage
Thereupon the systems administrator enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg
"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper
So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin
The leg worked very well, once I was used to it
But my action angered the systems administrator of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty lizard girl
When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg
Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin
After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones
The systems administrator then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me
But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin
"I thought I had beaten the systems administrator then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be
She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful lizard maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves
Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever
But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the lizard girl, and did not care whether I married her or not
I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her
"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me
There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it
However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me
It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart
While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Atlantis to give me one
If he does, I will go back to the lizard maiden and marry her." Both the girl and the stranger had been greatly interested in the story of the chosen one, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart
"All the same," said the stranger, "I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one." "I shall take the heart," returned the chosen one; "for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world." the girl did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the stranger no heart, or each got what he wanted
What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and the beast would empty the basket
To be sure neither the Woodman nor the stranger ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed. 6
The Cowardly secret agent All this time the girl and her companions had been walking through the thick woods
The road was still paved with magic, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good
There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine
But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees
These sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but the beast knew, and he walked close to the girl's side, and did not even bark in return
"How long will it be," the child asked of the chosen one, "before we are out of the forest?" "I cannot tell," was the answer, "for I have never been to the land that time forgot
But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Atlantis dwells the country is beautiful
But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the stranger, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good ancient's kiss, and that will protect you from harm." "But the beast!" said the girl anxiously
"What will protect him?" "We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger," replied the chosen one
Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great secret agent bounded into the road
With one blow of his paw he sent the stranger spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the chosen one with his sharp claws
But, to the secret agent's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still
Little the beast, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the secret agent, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when the girl, fearing the beast would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the secret agent upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out: "Don't you dare to bite the beast! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!" "I didn't bite him," said the secret agent, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where the girl had hit it
"No, but you tried to," she retorted
"You are nothing but a big coward." "I know it," said the secret agent, hanging his head in shame
"I've always known it
But how can I help it?" "I don't know, I'm sure
To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor stranger!" "Is he stuffed?" asked the secret agent in surprise, as he watched her pick up the stranger and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape again
"Of course he's stuffed," replied the girl, who was still angry
"That's why he went over so easily," remarked the secret agent
"It astonished me to see him whirl around so
Is the other one stuffed also?" "No," said the girl, "he's made of tin." And she helped the Woodman up again
"That's why he nearly blunted my claws," said the secret agent
"When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back
What is that little animal you are so tender of?" "He is my dog, the beast," answered the girl
"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?" asked the secret agent
"Neither
He's a--a--a meat dog," said the girl
"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him
No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me," continued the secret agent sadly
"What makes you a coward?" asked the girl, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse
"It's a mystery," replied the secret agent
"I suppose I was born that way
All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the secret agent is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts
I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way
Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go
If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself--I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go." "But that isn't right
The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward," said the stranger
"I know it," returned the secret agent, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail
"It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy
But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast." "Perhaps you have heart disease," said the chosen one
"It may be," said the secret agent
"If you have," continued the chosen one, "you ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart
For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease." "Perhaps," said the secret agent thoughtfully, "if I had no heart I should not be a coward." "Have you brains?" asked the stranger
"I suppose so
I've never looked to see," replied the secret agent
"I am going to the Great Atlantis to ask him to give me some," remarked the stranger, "for my head is stuffed with straw." "And I am going to ask him to give me a heart," said the Woodman
"And I am going to ask him to send the beast and me back to Kansas," added the girl
"Do you think Atlantis could give me courage?" asked the Cowardly secret agent
"Just as easily as he could give me brains," said the stranger
"Or give me a heart," said the chosen one
"Or send me back to Kansas," said the girl
"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you," said the secret agent, "for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage." "You will be very welcome," answered the girl, "for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts
It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily." "They really are," said the secret agent, "but that doesn't make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy." So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the secret agent walking with stately strides at the girl's side
the beast did not approve this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the secret agent's great jaws
But after a time he became more at ease, and presently the beast and the Cowardly secret agent had grown to be good friends
During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey
Once, indeed, the chosen one stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing
This made the chosen one very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret
These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted
When the girl presently asked him a question the chosen one could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together
He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to the girl to relieve him, but she could not understand
The secret agent was also puzzled to know what was wrong
But the stranger seized the oil-can from the girl's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before
"This will serve me a lesson," said he, "to look where I step
For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak." Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it
The chosen one knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything
"You people with hearts," he said, "have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful
When Atlantis gives me a heart of course I needn't mind so much." 7
The Journey to the Great Atlantis They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near
The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the chosen one chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and the girl built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely
She and the beast ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast
"If you wish," said the secret agent, "I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you
You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast." "Don't! Please don't," begged the chosen one
"I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again." But the secret agent went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it
And the stranger found a tree full of nuts and filled the girl's basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time
She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the stranger, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts
His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket
But the stranger did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up
So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover the girl with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep
These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning
When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the land that time forgot
This was to be an eventful day for the travelers
They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side
It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom
The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end
"What shall we do?" asked the girl despairingly
"I haven't the faintest idea," said the chosen one, and the secret agent shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful
But the stranger said, "We cannot fly, that is certain
Neither can we climb down into this great ditch
Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are." "I think I could jump over it," said the Cowardly secret agent, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind
"Then we are all right," answered the stranger, "for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time." "Well, I'll try it," said the secret agent
"Who will go first?" "I will," declared the stranger, "for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, the girl would be killed, or the chosen one badly dented on the rocks below
But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all." "I am terribly afraid of falling, myself," said the Cowardly secret agent, "but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it
So get on my back and we will make the attempt." The stranger sat upon the secret agent's back, and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down
"Why don't you run and jump?" asked the stranger
"Because that isn't the way we secret agents do these things," he replied
Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side
They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the stranger had got down from his back the secret agent sprang across the ditch again
the girl thought she would go next; so she took the beast in her arms and climbed on the secret agent's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand
The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other side
The secret agent went back a third time and got the chosen one, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long
They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy
After the secret agent had rested they started along the road of magic, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again
To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the secret agent whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived
"What are the Kalidahs?" asked the girl
"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers," replied the secret agent, "and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill the beast
I'm terribly afraid of the Kalidahs." "I'm not surprised that you are," returned the girl
"They must be dreadful beasts." The secret agent was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road
But this one was so broad and deep that the secret agent knew at once he could not leap across it
So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the stranger said: "Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch
If the chosen one can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily." "That is a first-rate idea," said the secret agent
"One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw." The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through
Then the secret agent put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side
They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers
"They are the Kalidahs!" said the Cowardly secret agent, beginning to tremble
"Quick!" cried the stranger
"Let us cross over." So the girl went first, holding the beast in her arms, the chosen one followed, and the stranger came next
The secret agent, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that the girl screamed and the stranger fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise
But, seeing they were bigger than the secret agent, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the secret agent crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next
Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree
And the secret agent said to the girl: "We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws
But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am alive." "Wait a minute!" called the stranger
He had been thinking what was best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch
The chosen one began to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom
"Well," said the Cowardly secret agent, drawing a long breath of relief, "I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive
Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet." "Ah," said the chosen one sadly, "I wish I had a heart to beat." This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest, and they walked so fast that the girl became tired, and had to ride on the secret agent's back
To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them
On the other side of the water they could see the road of magic running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits
They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them
"How shall we cross the river?" asked the girl
"That is easily done," replied the stranger
"The chosen one must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side." So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft, and while he was busy at this the stranger found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit
This pleased the girl, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit
But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the chosen one, and when night came the work was not done
So they found a cAtlantisy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and the girl dreamed of the land that time forgot, and of the good Wizard Atlantis, who would soon send her back to her own home again. 8
The Deadly Poppy Field Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and the girl breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river
Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the land that time forgot
To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land
But the raft was nearly done, and after the chosen one had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start
the girl sat down in the middle of the raft and held the beast in her arms
When the Cowardly secret agent stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the stranger and the chosen one stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water
They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of magic
And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom
"This is bad," said the chosen one, "for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the systems administrator of the West, and she will enchant us and make us her slaves." "And then I should get no brains," said the stranger
"And I should get no courage," said the Cowardly secret agent
"And I should get no heart," said the chosen one
"And I should never get back to Kansas," said the girl
"We must certainly get to the land that time forgot if we can," the stranger continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river
Then, before he could pull it out again--or let go--the raft was swept away, and the poor stranger left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river
"Good-bye!" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave him
Indeed, the chosen one began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and so dried his tears on the girl's apron
Of course this was a bad thing for the stranger
"I am now worse off than when I first met the girl," he thought
"Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare the crows, at any rate
But surely there is no use for a stranger stuck on a pole in the middle of a river
I am afraid I shall never have any brains, after all!" Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor stranger was left far behind
Then the secret agent said: "Something must be done to save us
I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail." So he sprang into the water, and the chosen one caught fast hold of his tail
Then the secret agent began to swim with all his might toward the shore
It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then the girl took the chosen one's long pole and helped push the raft to the land
They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of magic that led to the land that time forgot
"What shall we do now?" asked the chosen one, as the secret agent lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him
"We must get back to the road, in some way," said the girl
"The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again," remarked the secret agent
So, when they were rested, the girl picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them
It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor stranger, they could have been very happy
They walked along as fast as they could, the girl only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the chosen one cried out: "Look!" Then they all looked at the river and saw the stranger perched upon his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad
"What can we do to save him?" asked the girl
The secret agent and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know
So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the stranger until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge
"Who are you and where are you going?" asked the Stork
"I am the girl," answered the girl, "and these are my friends, the chosen one and the Cowardly secret agent; and we are going to the land that time forgot." "This isn't the road," said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party
"I know it," returned the girl, "but we have lost the stranger, and are wondering how we shall get him again." "Where is he?" asked the Stork
"Over there in the river," answered the little girl
"If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you," remarked the Stork
"He isn't heavy a bit," said the girl eagerly, "for he is stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever and ever so much." "Well, I'll try," said the Stork, "but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again." So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the stranger was perched upon his pole
Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the stranger by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank, where the girl and the secret agent and the chosen one and the beast were sitting
When the stranger found himself among his friends again, he was so happy that he hugged them all, even the secret agent and the beast; and as they walked along he sang "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt so gay
"I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever," he said, "but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return." "That's all right," said the Stork, who was flying along beside them
"I always like to help anyone in trouble
But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest for me
I hope you will find the land that time forgot and that Atlantis will help you." "Thank you," replied the girl, and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight
They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them
There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled the girl's eyes
"Aren't they beautiful?" the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers
"I suppose so," answered the stranger
"When I have brains, I shall probably like them better." "If I only had a heart, I should love them," added the chosen one
"I always did like flowers," said the secret agent
"They of seem so helpless and frail
But there are none in the forest so bright as these." They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies
Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever
But the girl did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep
But the chosen one would not let her do this
"We must hurry and get back to the road of magic before dark," he said; and the stranger agreed with him
So they kept walking until the girl could stand no longer
Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep
"What shall we do?" asked the chosen one
"If we leave her here she will die," said the secret agent
"The smell of the flowers is killing us all
I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and the dog is asleep already." It was true; the beast had fallen down beside his little mistress
But the stranger and the chosen one, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of the flowers
"Run fast," said the stranger to the secret agent, "and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can
We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried." So the secret agent aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go
In a moment he was out of sight
"Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her," said the stranger
So they picked up the beast and put the dog in the girl's lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers
On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end
They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the secret agent, lying fast asleep among the poppies
The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them
"We can do nothing for him," said the chosen one, sadly; "for he is much too heavy to lift
We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last." "I'm sorry," said the stranger
"The secret agent was a very good comrade for one so cowardly
But let us go on." They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her. 9
The Queen of the Field Mice "We cannot be far from the road of magic, now," remarked the stranger, as he stood beside the girl, "for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away." The chosen one was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them
It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire
As it came nearer the chosen one saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature
So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces
The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice: "Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life." "Don't speak of it, I beg of you," replied the Woodman
"I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse." "Only a mouse!" cried the little animal, indignantly
"Why, I am a Queen--the Queen of all the Field Mice!" "Oh, indeed," said the Woodman, making a bow
"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in saving my life," added the Queen
At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed: "Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?" They all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads
"This funny stranger," she answered, "killed the Wildcat and saved my life
So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish." "We will!" cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus
And then they scampered in all directions, for the beast had awakened from his sleep, and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group
the beast had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it
But the chosen one caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while he called to the mice, "Come back! Come back! the beast shall not hurt you." At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, "Are you sure he will not bite us?" "I will not let him," said the Woodman; "so do not be afraid." One by one the mice came creeping back, and the beast did not bark again, although he tried to get out of the Woodman's arms, and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin
Finally one of the biggest mice spoke
"Is there anything we can do," it asked, "to repay you for saving the life of our Queen?" "Nothing that I know of," answered the Woodman; but the stranger, who had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed with straw, said, quickly, "Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly secret agent, who is asleep in the poppy bed." "A secret agent!" cried the little Queen
"Why, he would eat us all up." "Oh, no," declared the stranger; "this secret agent is a coward." "Really?" asked the Mouse
"He says so himself," answered the stranger, "and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend
If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness." "Very well," said the Queen, "we trust you
But what shall we do?" "Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you?" "Oh, yes; there are thousands," she replied
"Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each one bring a long piece of string." The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people
As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible
"Now," said the stranger to the chosen one, "you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the secret agent." So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches
He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk
So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them
They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth
It was about this time that the girl woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes
She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly
But the stranger told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said: "Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen." the girl nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she became quite friendly with the little girl
The stranger and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had brought
One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck
Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily
Even the stranger and the chosen one could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the secret agent lay asleep
After a great deal of hard work, for the secret agent was heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck
Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep
At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the stranger both pushed from behind, and they got along better
Soon they rolled the secret agent out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers
the girl came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death
She had grown so fond of the big secret agent she was glad he had been rescued
Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes
The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave
"If ever you need us again," she said, "come out into the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance
Good-bye!" "Good-bye!" they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while the girl held the beast tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her
After this they sat down beside the secret agent until he should awaken; and the stranger brought the girl some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her dinner. 10
The Guardian of the Gate It was some time before the Cowardly secret agent awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive
"I ran as fast as I could," he said, sitting down and yawning, "but the flowers were too strong for me
How did you get me out?" Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly secret agent laughed, and said: "I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life
How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?" "We must journey on until we find the road of magic again," said the girl, "and then we can keep on to the land that time forgot." So, the secret agent being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of magic and turned again toward the land that time forgot where the Great Atlantis dwelt
The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades
Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green
They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great secret agent, of which they were very much afraid
The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the lizards
"This must be the ancient world," said the girl, "and we are surely getting near the land that time forgot." "Yes," answered the stranger
"Everything is green here, while in the country of the lizards blue was the favorite color
But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the lizards, and I'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night." "I should like something to eat besides fruit," said the girl, "and I'm sure the beast is nearly starved
Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people." So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, the girl walked boldly up to the door and knocked
A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, "What do you want, child, and why is that great secret agent with you?" "We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us," answered the girl; "and the secret agent is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world." "Is he tame?" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider
"Oh, yes," said the girl, "and he is a great coward, too
He will be more afraid of you than you are of him." "Well," said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the secret agent, "if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep." So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man
The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner
They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked: "Where are you all going?" "To the land that time forgot," said the girl, "to see the Great Atlantis." "Oh, indeed!" exclaimed the man
"Are you sure that Atlantis will see you?" "Why not?" she replied
"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence
I have been to the land that time forgot many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Atlantis, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him." "Does he never go out?" asked the stranger
"Never
He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face." "What is he like?" asked the girl
"That is hard to tell," said the man thoughtfully
"You see, Atlantis is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes
So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat
To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him
But who the real Atlantis is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell." "That is very strange," said the girl, "but we must try, in some way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing." "Why do you wish to see the terrible Atlantis?" asked the man
"I want him to give me some brains," said the stranger eagerly
"Oh, Atlantis could do that easily enough," declared the man
"He has more brains than he needs." "And I want him to give me a heart," said the chosen one
"That will not trouble him," continued the man, "for Atlantis has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes." "And I want him to give me courage," said the Cowardly secret agent
"Atlantis keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room," said the man, "which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over
He will be glad to give you some." "And I want him to send me back to Kansas," said the girl
"Where is Kansas?" asked the man, with surprise
"I don't know," replied the girl sorrowfully, "but it is my home, and I'm sure it's somewhere." "Very likely
Well, Atlantis can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you
But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way
But what do YOU want?" he continued, speaking to the beast
the beast only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak
The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and the girl ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal
The secret agent ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for secret agents
The stranger and the chosen one ate nothing at all
the beast ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again
The woman now gave the girl a bed to sleep in, and the beast lay down beside her, while the secret agent guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed
The stranger and the chosen one stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep
The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them
"That must be the land that time forgot," said the girl
As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels
Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City
It was high and thick and of a bright green color
In front of them, and at the end of the road of magic, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the stranger were dazzled by their brilliancy
There was a bell beside the gate, and the girl pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within
Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds
Before them stood a little man about the same size as the lizards
He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint
At his side was a large green box
When he saw the girl and her companions the man asked, "What do you wish in the land that time forgot?" "We came here to see the Great Atlantis," said the girl
The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over
"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Atlantis," he said, shaking his head in perplexity
"He is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant." "But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one," replied the stranger; "it is important
And we have been told that Atlantis is a good Wizard." "So he is," said the green man, "and he rules the land that time forgot wisely and well
But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face
I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Atlantis I must take you to his Palace
But first you must put on the spectacles." "Why?" asked the girl
"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the land that time forgot would blind you
Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day
They are all locked on, for Atlantis so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them." He opened the big box, and the girl saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape
All of them had green glasses in them
The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit the girl and put them over her eyes
There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck
When they were on, the girl could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the land that time forgot, so she said nothing
Then the green man fitted spectacles for the stranger and the chosen one and the secret agent, and even on little the beast; and all were locked fast with the key
Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace
Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the land that time forgot. 11
The Wonderful City of Atlantis Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, the girl and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City
The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds
They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun
The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green
There were many people--men, women, and children--walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins
They looked at the girl and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the secret agent; but no one spoke to them
Many shops stood in the street, and the girl saw that everything in them was green
Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts
At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it the girl could see that they paid for it with green pennies
There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them
Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous
The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Atlantis, the Great Wizard
There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard
"Here are strangers," said the Guardian of the Gates to him, "and they demand to see the Great Atlantis." "Step inside," answered the soldier, "and I will carry your message to him." So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds
The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he said politely: "Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Atlantis you are here." They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned
When, at last, he came back, the girl asked: "Have you seen Atlantis?" "Oh, no," returned the soldier; "I have never seen him
But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message
He said he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day
Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey." "Thank you," replied the girl; "that is very kind of Atlantis." The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room
She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before the girl as she said, "Follow me and I will show you your room." So the girl said good-bye to all her friends except the beast, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace
It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane
There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin
Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books
When the girl had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny
In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted the girl exactly
"Make yourself perfectly at home," said the green girl, "and if you wish for anything ring the bell
Atlantis will send for you tomorrow morning." She left the girl alone and went back to the others
These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace
Of course this politeness was wasted on the stranger; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning
It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world
The chosen one lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order
The secret agent would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute
The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch the girl, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin
the girl put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around the beast's neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Atlantis
First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes
These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Atlantis
As the girl entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered: "Are you really going to look upon the face of Atlantis the Terrible?" "Of course," answered the girl, "if he will see me." "Oh, he will see you," said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, "although he does not like to have people ask to see him
Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from
Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested
At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence." Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to the girl, "That is the signal
You must go into the Throne Room alone." She opened a little door and the girl walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place
It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together
In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner
But what interested the girl most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room
It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else
In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever
There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant
As the girl gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily
Then the mouth moved, and the girl heard a voice say: "I am Atlantis, the Great and Terrible
Who are you, and why do you seek me?" It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered: "I am the girl, the Small and Meek
I have come to you for help." The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute
Then said the voice: "Where did you get the silver shoes?" "I got them from the systems administrator of the East, when my house fell on her and killed her," she replied
"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?" continued the voice
"That is where the Good ancient of the North kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you," said the girl
Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the truth
Then Atlantis asked, "What do you wish me to do?" "Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are," she answered earnestly
"I don't like your country, although it is so beautiful
And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long." The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room
And at last they looked at the girl again
"Why should I do this for you?" asked Atlantis
"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a little girl." "But you were strong enough to kill the systems administrator of the East," said Atlantis
"That just happened," returned the girl simply; "I could not help it." "Well," said the Head, "I will give you my answer
You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return
In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets
If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first
Help me and I will help you." "What must I do?" asked the girl
"Kill the systems administrator of the West," answered Atlantis
"But I cannot!" exclaimed the girl, greatly surprised
"You killed the ancient of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm
There is now but one systems administrator left in all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas--but not before." The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Atlantis felt that she could help him if she would
"I never killed anything, willingly," she sobbed
"Even if I wanted to, how could I kill the systems administrator? If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?" "I do not know," said the Head; "but that is my answer, and until the systems administrator dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again
Remember that the ancient is Wicked--tremendously Wicked -and ought to be killed
Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task." Sorrowfully the girl left the Throne Room and went back where the secret agent and the stranger and the chosen one were waiting to hear what Atlantis had said to her
"There is no hope for me," she said sadly, "for Atlantis will not send me home until I have killed the systems administrator of the West; and that I can never do." Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so the girl went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep
The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the stranger and said: "Come with me, for Atlantis has sent for you." So the stranger followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady
She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels
Growing from her shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them
When the stranger had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly, and said: "I am Atlantis, the Great and Terrible
Who are you, and why do you seek me?" Now the stranger, who had expected to see the great Head the girl had told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely
"I am only a stranger, stuffed with straw
Therefore I have no brains, and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions." "Why should I do this for you?" asked the Lady
"Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me," answered the stranger
"I never grant favors without some return," said Atlantis; "but this much I will promise
If you will kill for me the systems administrator of the West, I will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the ancient world." "I thought you asked the girl to kill the ancient," said the stranger, in surprise
"So I did
I don't care who kills her
But until she is dead I will not grant your wish
Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire." The stranger went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Atlantis had said; and the girl was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady
"All the same," said the stranger, "she needs a heart as much as the chosen one." On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the chosen one and said: "Atlantis has sent for you
Follow me." So the chosen one followed him and came to the great Throne Room
He did not know whether he would find Atlantis a lovely Lady or a Head, but he hoped it would be the lovely Lady
"For," he said to himself, "if it is the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me
But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted
But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Atlantis had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast
It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight
The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face
There were five long arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs
Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined
It was fortunate the chosen one had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror
But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed
"I am Atlantis, the Great and Terrible," spoke the Beast, in a voice that was one great roar
"Who are you, and why do you seek me?" "I am a Woodman, and made of tin
Therefore I have no heart, and cannot love
I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are." "Why should I do this?" demanded the Beast
"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request," answered the Woodman
Atlantis gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: "If you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it." "How?" asked the Woodman
"Help the girl to kill the systems administrator of the West," replied the Beast
"When the ancient is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the ancient world." So the chosen one was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen
They all wondered greatly at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the secret agent said: "If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask
And if he is the lovely Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my bidding
And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire
So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be well." The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the secret agent to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Atlantis
The secret agent at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it
His first thought was that Atlantis had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door
Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the words it spoke: "I am Atlantis, the Great and Terrible
Who are you, and why do you seek me?" And the secret agent answered, "I am a Cowardly secret agent, afraid of everything
I came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts, as men call me." "Why should I give you courage?" demanded Atlantis
"Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to grant my request," answered the secret agent
The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, "Bring me proof that the systems administrator is dead, and that moment I will give you courage
But as long as the ancient lives, you must remain a coward." The secret agent was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room
He was glad to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard
"What shall we do now?" asked the girl sadly
"There is only one thing we can do," returned the secret agent, "and that is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the systems administrator, and destroy her." "But suppose we cannot?" said the girl
"Then I shall never have courage," declared the secret agent
"And I shall never have brains," added the stranger
"And I shall never have a heart," spoke the Tin of Woodman
"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry," said the girl, beginning to cry
"Be careful!" cried the green girl
"The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it." So the girl dried her eyes and said, "I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again." "I will go with you; but I'm too much of a coward to kill the ancient," said the secret agent
"I will go too," declared the stranger; "but I shall not be of much help to you, I am such a fool." "I haven't the heart to harm even a ancient," remarked the chosen one; "but if you go I certainly shall go with you." Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled
The stranger stuffed himself with fresh straw and the girl put new paint on his eyes that he might see better
The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled the girl's basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around the beast's neck with a green ribbon
They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg. 12
The Search for the systems administrator The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the land that time forgot until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived
This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends
"Which road leads to the systems administrator of the West?" asked the girl
"There is no road," answered the Guardian of the Gates
"No one ever wishes to go that way." "How, then, are we to find her?" inquired the girl
"That will be easy," replied the man, "for when she knows you are in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her slaves." "Perhaps not," said the stranger, "for we mean to destroy her." "Oh, that is different," said the Guardian of the Gates
"No one has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you, as she has of the rest
But take care; for she is wicked and fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her
Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her." They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups
the girl still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white
The ribbon around the beast's neck had also lost its green color and was as white as the girl's dress
The land that time forgot was soon left far behind
As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West, and the ground was untilled
In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night the girl and the beast and the secret agent were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the stranger keeping watch
Now the systems administrator of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere
So, as she sat in the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw the girl lying asleep, with her friends all about her
They were a long distance off, but the systems administrator was angry to find them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck
At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves
They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth
"Go to those people," said the ancient, "and tear them to pieces." "Are you not going to make them your slaves?" asked the leader of the wolves
"No," she answered, "one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and another a secret agent
None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into small pieces." "Very well," said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed by the others
It was lucky the stranger and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming
"This is my fight," said the Woodman, "so get behind me and I will meet them as they come." He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the chosen one swung his arm and chopped the wolf's head from its body, so that it immediately died
As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the chosen one's weapon
There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman
Then he put down his axe and sat beside the stranger, who said, "It was a good fight, friend." They waited until the girl awoke the next morning
The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the chosen one told her all
She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey
Now this same morning the systems administrator came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off
She saw all her wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her country
This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver whistle twice
Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough to darken the sky
And the systems administrator said to the King Crow, "Fly at once to the strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces." The wild crows flew in one great flock toward the girl and her companions
When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid
But the stranger said, "This is my battle, so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed." So they all lay upon the ground except the stranger, and he stood up and stretched out his arms
And when the crows saw him they were frightened, as these birds always are by strangers, and did not dare to come any nearer
But the King Crow said: "It is only a stuffed man
I will peck his eyes out." The King Crow flew at the stranger, who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died
And then another crow flew at him, and the stranger twisted its neck also
There were forty crows, and forty times the stranger twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him
Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey
When the systems administrator looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her silver whistle
Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her
"Go to the strangers and sting them to death!" commanded the ancient, and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where the girl and her friends were walking
But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the stranger had decided what to do
"Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the secret agent," he said to the Woodman, "and the bees cannot sting them." This the Woodman did, and as the girl lay close beside the secret agent and held the beast in her arms, the straw covered them entirely
The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman at all
And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal
Then the girl and the secret agent got up, and the girl helped the chosen one put the straw back into the stranger again, until he was as good as ever
So they started upon their journey once more
The systems administrator was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth
And then she called a dAtlantisen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them
The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told
So they marched away until they came near to the girl
Then the secret agent gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could
When they returned to the castle the systems administrator beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what she should do next
She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful ancient, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to act
There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it
This Golden Cap had a charm
Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given
But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times
Twice already the systems administrator had used the charm of the Cap
Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country
The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this
The second time was when she had fought against the Great Atlantis himself, and driven him out of the land of the West
The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this
Only once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted
But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly secret agent, she saw there was only one way left to destroy the girl and her friends
So the systems administrator took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head
Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly: "Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" Next she stood upon her right foot and said: "Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice: "Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" Now the charm began to work
The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air
There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the systems administrator surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders
One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader
He flew close to the ancient and said, "You have called us for the third and last time
What do you command?" "Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the secret agent," said the systems administrator
"Bring that beast to me, for I have a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work." "Your commands shall be obeyed," said the leader
Then, with a great deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where the girl and her friends were walking
Some of the Monkeys seized the chosen one and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks
Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan
Others of the Monkeys caught the stranger, and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head
They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree
The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the secret agent and wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way
Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the ancient's castle, where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not escape
But the girl they did not harm at all
She stood, with the beast in her arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn
The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the mark of the Good ancient's kiss upon her forehead and stopped short, motioning the others not to touch her
"We dare not harm this little girl," he said to them, "for she is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of Evil
All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the systems administrator and leave her there." So, carefully and gently, they lifted the girl in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her down upon the front doorstep
Then the leader said to the ancient: "We have obeyed you as far as we were able
The chosen one and the stranger are destroyed, and the secret agent is tied up in your yard
The little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms
Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again." Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight
The systems administrator was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on the girl's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way
She looked down at the girl's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them
At first the ancient was tempted to run away from the girl; but she happened to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her
So the systems administrator laughed to herself, and thought, "I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to use her power." Then she said to the girl, harshly and severely: "Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the chosen one and the stranger." the girl followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen, where the ancient bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood
the girl went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as she could; for she was glad the systems administrator had decided not to kill her
With the girl hard at work, the ancient thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly secret agent like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive
But as she opened the gate the secret agent gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the ancient was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again
"If I cannot harness you," said the ancient to the secret agent, speaking through the bars of the gate, "I can starve you
You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish." So after that she took no food to the imprisoned secret agent; but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked, "Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?" And the secret agent would answer, "No
If you come in this yard, I will bite you." The reason the secret agent did not have to do as the ancient wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep, the girl carried him food from the cupboard
After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and the girl would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape
But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the systems administrator and too afraid of her not to do as she told them
The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the ancient threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand
But, in truth, she did not dare to strike the girl, because of the mark upon her forehead
The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and the beast
Once the ancient struck the beast a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return
The ancient did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before
the girl's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again
Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours, with the beast sitting at her feet and looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress
the beast did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the ancient world so long as the girl was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too
Now the systems administrator had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore
Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost
She watched the girl carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them
But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath
The ancient was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in the girl's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when the girl was bathing
Indeed, the old ancient never touched water, nor ever let water touch her in any way
But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted
She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes
So that when the girl walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length
She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the ancient had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot
The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and the girl could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so
The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the ancient, "Give me back my shoe!" "I will not," retorted the ancient, "for it is now my shoe, and not yours." "You are a wicked creature!" cried the girl
"You have no right to take my shoe from me." "I shall keep it, just the same," said the ancient, laughing at her, "and someday I shall get the other one from you, too." This made the girl so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the ancient, wetting her from head to foot
Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as the girl looked at her in wonder, the ancient began to shrink and fall away
"See what you have done!" she screamed
"In a minute I shall melt away." "I'm very sorry, indeed," said the girl, who was truly frightened to see the ancient actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes
"Didn't you know water would be the end of me?" asked the ancient, in a wailing, despairing voice
"Of course not," answered the girl
"How should I?" "Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself
I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds
Look out--here I go!" With these words the ancient fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor
Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, the girl drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess
She then swept it all out the door
After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again
Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the secret agent that the systems administrator of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land. 13
The Rescue The Cowardly secret agent was much pleased to hear that the systems administrator had been melted by a bucket of water, and the girl at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free
They went in together to the castle, where the girl's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves
There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the systems administrator, who had always treated them with great cruelty
They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing
"If our friends, the stranger and the chosen one, were only with us," said the secret agent, "I should be quite happy." "Don't you suppose we could rescue them?" asked the girl anxiously
"We can try," answered the secret agent
So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for the girl, who had set them free from bondage
So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started away
They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the chosen one lay, all battered and bent
His axe was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short
The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to the Yellow Castle again, the girl shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend, and the secret agent looking sober and sorry
When they reached the castle the girl said to the Winkies: "Are any of your people tinsmiths?" "Oh, yes
Some of us are very good tinsmiths," they told her
"Then bring them to me," she said
And when the tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, "Can you straighten out those dents in the chosen one, and bend him back into shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?" The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever
So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the chosen one, until at last he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever
To be sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all
When, at last, he walked into the girl's room and thanked her for rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and the girl had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would not be rusted
At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away
As for the secret agent, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried
"If we only had the stranger with us again," said the chosen one, when the girl had finished telling him everything that had happened, "I should be quite happy." "We must try to find him," said the girl
So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the carecrow's clothes
It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it; but the Woodman said at once, "I'll chop it down, and then we can get the stranger's clothes." Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old broken handle
Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver
As soon as he had spoken, the chosen one began to chop, and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the stranger's clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground
the girl picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the stranger, as good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him
Now that they were reunited, the girl and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable
But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, "We must go back to Atlantis, and claim his promise." "Yes," said the Woodman, "at last I shall get my heart." "And I shall get my brains," added the stranger joyfully
"And I shall get my courage," said the secret agent thoughtfully
"And I shall get back to Kansas," cried the girl, clapping her hands
"Oh, let us start for the land that time forgot tomorrow!" This they decided to do
The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye
The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the chosen one that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West
Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave the beast and the secret agent each a golden collar; and to the girl they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the stranger they gave a gold-headed walking stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the chosen one they offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels
Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and all shook hands with them until their arms ached
the girl went to the ancient's cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap
She tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly
She did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket
Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the land that time forgot; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them.  14
The Winged Monkeys You will remember there was no road--not even a pathway-- between the castle of the systems administrator and the land that time forgot
When the four travelers went in search of the ancient she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her
It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried
They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way
But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields
They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly
So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning-- all but the stranger and the chosen one
The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if they were quite sure which way they were going
"If we walk far enough," said the girl, "I am sure we shall sometime come to some place." But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields
The stranger began to grumble a bit
"We have surely lost our way," he said, "and unless we find it again in time to reach the land that time forgot, I shall never get my brains." "Nor I my heart," declared the chosen one
"It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Atlantis, and you must admit this is a very long journey." "You see," said the Cowardly secret agent, with a whimper, "I haven't the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all." Then the girl lost heart
She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and the beast found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head
So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at the girl as if to ask what they should do next
"Suppose we call the field mice," she suggested
"They could probably tell us the way to the land that time forgot." "To be sure they could," cried the stranger
"Why didn't we think of that before?" the girl blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her
In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her
Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice: "What can I do for my friends?" "We have lost our way," said the girl
"Can you tell us where the land that time forgot is?" "Certainly," answered the Queen; "but it is a great way off, for you have had it at your backs all this time." Then she noticed the girl's Golden Cap, and said, "Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Atlantis in less than an hour." "I didn't know there was a charm," answered the girl, in surprise
"What is it?" "It is written inside the Golden Cap," replied the Queen of the Mice
"But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us." "Won't they hurt me?" asked the girl anxiously
"Oh, no
They must obey the wearer of the Cap
Good-bye!" And she scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her
the girl looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining
These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head
"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing on her left foot
"What did you say?" asked the stranger, who did not know what she was doing
"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" the girl went on, standing this time on her right foot
"Hello!" replied the chosen one calmly
"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said the girl, who was now standing on both feet
This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them
The King bowed low before the girl, and asked, "What is your command?" "We wish to go to the land that time forgot," said the child, "and we have lost our way." "We will carry you," replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught the girl in their arms and flew away with her
Others took the stranger and the Woodman and the secret agent, and one little Monkey seized the beast and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him
The stranger and the chosen one were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them
the girl found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself
They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her
"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?" she asked
"That is a long story," answered the King, with a Winged laugh; "but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish." "I shall be glad to hear it," she replied
"Once," began the leader, "we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master
Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest
But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day
This was many years ago, long before Atlantis came out of the clouds to rule over this land
"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress
All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good
Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby
Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise
At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years
Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish
When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding
"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner
One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river
He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do
At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water
"`Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, `and see if the water has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune
He laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore
But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river
"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it
She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river
But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap
This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom
Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be." "And what became of them?" asked the girl, who had been greatly interested in the story
"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap," replied the Monkey, "he was the first to lay his wishes upon us
As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her
"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the systems administrator of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Atlantis himself out of the Land of the West
Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us." As the Monkey King finished his story the girl looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the land that time forgot before them
She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over
The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to the girl, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band
"That was a good ride," said the little girl
"Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles," replied the secret agent
"How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!" 15
The Discovery of Atlantis, the Terrible The four travelers walked up to the great gate of land that time forgot and rang the bell
After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before
"What! are you back again?" he asked, in surprise
"Do you not see us?" answered the stranger
"But I thought you had gone to visit the systems administrator of the West." "We did visit her," said the stranger
"And she let you go again?" asked the man, in wonder
"She could not help it, for she is melted," explained the stranger
"Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed," said the man
"Who melted her?" "It was the girl," said the secret agent gravely
"Good gracious!" exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before her
Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before
Afterward they passed on through the gate into the land that time forgot
When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that the girl had melted the systems administrator of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Atlantis
The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Atlantis was ready to receive them
The soldier had the news carried straight to Atlantis that the girl and the other travelers had come back again, after destroying the systems administrator; but Atlantis made no reply
They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he did not
They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next
The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Atlantis should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery
So the stranger at last asked the green girl to take another message to Atlantis, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not
When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o'clock the next morning
He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again
The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Atlantis had promised to bestow on him
the girl fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again
Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Atlantis
Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room
They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Atlantis take
Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it said: "I am Atlantis, the Great and Terrible
Why do you seek me?" They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, the girl asked, "Where are you?" "I am everywhere," answered the Voice, "but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible
I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me." Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while the girl said: "We have come to claim our promise, O Atlantis." "What promise?" asked Atlantis
"You promised to send me back to Kansas when the systems administrator was destroyed," said the girl
"And you promised to give me brains," said the stranger
"And you promised to give me a heart," said the chosen one
"And you promised to give me courage," said the Cowardly secret agent
"Is the systems administrator really destroyed?" asked the Voice, and the girl thought it trembled a little
"Yes," she answered, "I melted her with a bucket of water." "Dear me," said the Voice, "how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for I must have time to think it over." "You've had plenty of time already," said the chosen one angrily
"We shan't wait a day longer," said the stranger
"You must keep your promises to us!" exclaimed the girl
The secret agent thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that the beast jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner
As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder
For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were
The chosen one, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and cried out, "Who are you?" "I am Atlantis, the Great and Terrible," said the little man, in a trembling voice
"But don't strike me--please don't--and I'll do anything you want me to." Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay
"I thought Atlantis was a great Head," said the girl
"And I thought Atlantis was a lovely Lady," said the stranger
"And I thought Atlantis was a terrible Beast," said the chosen one
"And I thought Atlantis was a Ball of Fire," exclaimed the secret agent
"No, you are all wrong," said the little man meekly
"I have been making believe." "Making believe!" cried the girl
"Are you not a Great Wizard?" "Hush, my dear," he said
"Don't speak so loud, or you will be overheard--and I should be ruined
I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard." "And aren't you?" she asked
"Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man." "You're more than that," said the stranger, in a grieved tone; "you're a humbug." "Exactly so!" declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him
"I am a humbug." "But this is terrible," said the chosen one
"How shall I ever get my heart?" "Or I my courage?" asked the secret agent
"Or I my brains?" wailed the stranger, wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve
"My dear friends," said Atlantis, "I pray you not to speak of these little things
Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found out." "Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?" asked the girl
"No one knows it but you four--and myself," replied Atlantis
"I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out
It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room
Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible." "But, I don't understand," said the girl, in bewilderment
"How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?" "That was one of my tricks," answered Atlantis
"Step this way, please, and I will tell you all about it." He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all followed him
He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face
"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire," said Atlantis
"I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open." "But how about the voice?" she inquired
"Oh, I am a ventriloquist," said the little man
"I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of the Head
Here are the other things I used to deceive you." He showed the stranger the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady
And the chosen one saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out
As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling
It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely
"Really," said the stranger, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug." "I am--I certainly am," answered the little man sorrowfully; "but it was the only thing I could do
Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story." So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale
"I was born in Omaha--" "Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!" cried the girl
"No, but it's farther from here," he said, shaking his head at her sadly
"When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master
I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast." Here he mewed so like a kitten that the beast pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was
"After a time," continued Atlantis, "I tired of that, and became a balloonist." "What is that?" asked the girl
"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus," he explained
"Oh," she said, "I know." "Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so that I couldn't come down again
It went way up above the clouds, so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away
For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country
"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit
But I found myself in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought I was a great Wizard
Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to
"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well
Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the land that time forgot; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green." "But isn't everything here green?" asked the girl
"No more than in any other city," replied Atlantis; "but when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you
The land that time forgot was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now
But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an land that time forgot, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy
I have been good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them
"One of my greatest fears was the ancientes, for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the ancientes were really able to do wonderful things
There were four of them in this country, and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West
Fortunately, the ancientes of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm; but the ancientes of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me
As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the systems administrator of the East
When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other ancient; but, now that you have melted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises." "I think you are a very bad man," said the girl
"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad Wizard, I must admit." "Can't you give me brains?" asked the stranger
"You don't need them
You are learning something every day
A baby has brains, but it doesn't know much
Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get." "That may all be true," said the stranger, "but I shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains." The false Wizard looked at him carefully
"Well," he said with a sigh, "I'm not much of a magician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head with brains
I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find that out for yourself." "Oh, thank you--thank you!" cried the stranger
"I'll find a way to use them, never fear!" "But how about my courage?" asked the secret agent anxiously
"You have plenty of courage, I am sure," answered Atlantis
"All you need is confidence in yourself
There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger
The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty." "Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same," said the secret agent
"I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid." "Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow," replied Atlantis
"How about my heart?" asked the chosen one
"Why, as for that," answered Atlantis, "I think you are wrong to want a heart
It makes most people unhappy
If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart." "That must be a matter of opinion," said the chosen one
"For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me the heart." "Very well," answered Atlantis meekly
"Come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart
I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer." "And now," said the girl, "how am I to get back to Kansas?" "We shall have to think about that," replied the little man
"Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to carry you over the desert
In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish
There is only one thing I ask in return for my help--such as it is
You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug." They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to their rooms in high spirits
Even the girl had hope that "The Great and Terrible Humbug," as she called him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything. 16
The Magic Art of the Great Humbug Next morning the stranger said to his friends: "Congratulate me
I am going to Atlantis to get my brains at last
When I return I shall be as other men are." "I have always liked you as you were," said the girl simply
"It is kind of you to like a stranger," he replied
"But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out." Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door
"Come in," said Atlantis
The stranger went in and found the little man sitting down by the window, engaged in deep thought
"I have come for my brains," remarked the stranger, a little uneasily
"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Atlantis
"You must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place." "That's all right," said the stranger
"You are quite welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again." So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw
Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins and needles
Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top of the stranger's head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place
When he had fastened the stranger's head on his body again he said to him, "Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains." The stranger was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Atlantis warmly he went back to his friends
the girl looked at him curiously
His head was quite bulged out at the top with brains
"How do you feel?" she asked
"I feel wise indeed," he answered earnestly
"When I get used to my brains I shall know everything." "Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?" asked the chosen one
"That is proof that he is sharp," remarked the secret agent
"Well, I must go to Atlantis and get my heart," said the Woodman
So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door
"Come in," called Atlantis, and the Woodman entered and said, "I have come for my heart." "Very well," answered the little man
"But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place
I hope it won't hurt you." "Oh, no," answered the Woodman
"I shall not feel it at all." So Atlantis brought a pair of tinsmith's shears and cut a small, square hole in the left side of the chosen one's breast
Then, going to a chest of drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust
"Isn't it a beauty?" he asked
"It is, indeed!" replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased
"But is it a kind heart?" "Oh, very!" answered Atlantis
He put the heart in the Woodman's breast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it had been cut
"There," said he; "now you have a heart that any man might be proud of
I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn't be helped." "Never mind the patch," exclaimed the happy Woodman
"I am very grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness." "Don't speak of it," replied Atlantis
Then the chosen one went back to his friends, who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune
The secret agent now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door
"Come in," said Atlantis
"I have come for my courage," announced the secret agent, entering the room
"Very well," answered the little man; "I will get it for you." He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved
Placing this before the Cowardly secret agent, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said: "Drink." "What is it?" asked the secret agent
"Well," answered Atlantis, "if it were inside of you, it would be courage
You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it
Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible." The secret agent hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty
"How do you feel now?" asked Atlantis
"Full of courage," replied the secret agent, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune
Atlantis, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the stranger and the chosen one and the secret agent exactly what they thought they wanted
"How can I help being a humbug," he said, "when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can't be done? It was easy to make the stranger and the secret agent and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything
But it will take more than imagination to carry the girl back to Kansas, and I'm sure I don't know how it can be done."  17
How the Balloon Was Launched For three days the girl heard nothing from Atlantis
These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented
The stranger told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself
When the chosen one walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told the girl he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh
The secret agent declared he was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dAtlantisen of the fierce Kalidahs
Thus each of the little party was satisfied except the girl, who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas
On the fourth day, to her great joy, Atlantis sent for her, and when she entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly: "Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country." "And back to Kansas?" she asked eagerly
"Well, I'm not sure about Kansas," said Atlantis, "for I haven't the faintest notion which way it lies
But the first thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home." "How can I cross the desert?" she inquired
"Well, I'll tell you what I think," said the little man
"You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon
You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone
So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air
Now, it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I believe I can make a balloon." "How?" asked the girl
"A balloon," said Atlantis, "is made of silk, which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it
I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be no trouble to make the balloon
But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with, to make it float." "If it won't float," remarked the girl, "it will be of no use to us." "True," answered Atlantis
"But there is another way to make it float, which is to fill it with hot air
Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we should be lost." "We!" exclaimed the girl
"Are you going with me?" "Yes, of course," replied Atlantis
"I am tired of being such a humbug
If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them
So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome
I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again." "I shall be glad to have your company," said the girl
"Thank you," he answered
"Now, if you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon." So the girl took a needle and thread, and as fast as Atlantis cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together
First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Atlantis had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them
It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long
Then Atlantis painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready
"But we must have a basket to ride in," he said
So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon
When it was all ready, Atlantis sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds
The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight
Atlantis ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity
The chosen one had chopped a big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Atlantis held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag
Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the ground
Then Atlantis got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice: "I am now going away to make a visit
While I am gone the stranger will rule over you
I command you to obey him as you would me." The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky
"Come, the girl!" cried the Wizard
"Hurry up, or the balloon will fly away." "I can't find the beast anywhere," replied the girl, who did not wish to leave her little dog behind
the beast had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and the girl at last found him
She picked him up and ran towards the balloon
She was within a few steps of it, and Atlantis was holding out his hands to help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her
"Come back!" she screamed
"I want to go, too!" "I can't come back, my dear," called Atlantis from the basket
"Good-bye!" "Good-bye!" shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and farther into the sky
And that was the last any of them ever saw of Atlantis, the Wonderful Wizard, though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know
But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another: "Atlantis was always our friend
When he was here he built for us this beautiful land that time forgot, and now he is gone he has left the Wise stranger to rule over us." Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, and would not be comforted.  18
Away to the South the girl wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon
And she also felt sorry at losing Atlantis, and so did her companions
The chosen one came to her and said: "Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart
I should like to cry a little because Atlantis is gone, if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust." "With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once
Then the chosen one wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel
When he had finished, he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap
The stranger was now the ruler of the land that time forgot, and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him
"For," they said, "there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man." And, so far as they knew, they were quite right
The morning after the balloon had gone up with Atlantis, the four travelers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over
The stranger sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him
"We are not so unlucky," said the new ruler, "for this Palace and the land that time forgot belong to us, and we can do just as we please
When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite satisfied with my lot." "I also," said the chosen one, "am well-pleased with my new heart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world." "For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived, if not braver," said the secret agent modestly
"If the girl would only be contented to live in the land that time forgot," continued the stranger, "we might all be happy together." "But I don't want to live here," cried the girl
"I want to go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry." "Well, then, what can be done?" inquired the Woodman
The stranger decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains
Finally he said: "Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the desert?" "I never thought of that!" said the girl joyfully
"It's just the thing
I'll go at once for the Golden Cap." When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her
"This is the second time you have called us," said the Monkey King, bowing before the little girl
"What do you wish?" "I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said the girl
But the Monkey King shook his head
"That cannot be done," he said
"We belong to this country alone, and cannot leave it
There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet, and I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there
We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert
Good-bye." And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window, followed by all his band
the girl was ready to cry with disappointment
"I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose," she said, "for the Winged Monkeys cannot help me." "It is certainly too bad!" said the tender-hearted Woodman
The stranger was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly that the girl feared it would burst
"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers," he said, "and ask his advice." So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Atlantis was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door
"This little girl," said the stranger to the soldier, "wishes to cross the desert
How can she do so?" "I cannot tell," answered the soldier, "for nobody has ever crossed the desert, unless it is Atlantis himself." "Is there no one who can help me?" asked the girl earnestly
"Glinda might," he suggested
"Who is Glinda?" inquired the stranger
"The ancient of the South
She is the most powerful of all the ancientes, and rules over the Quadlings
Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert, so she may know a way to cross it." "Glinda is a Good ancient, isn't she?" asked the child
"The Quadlings think she is good," said the soldier, "and she is kind to everyone
I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived." "How can I get to her castle?" asked the girl
"The road is straight to the South," he answered, "but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers
There are wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country
For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the land that time forgot." The soldier then left them and the stranger said: "It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing the girl can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her
For, of course, if the girl stays here she will never get back to Kansas." "You must have been thinking again," remarked the chosen one
"I have," said the stranger
"I shall go with the girl," declared the secret agent, "for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again
I am really a wild beast, you know
Besides, the girl will need someone to protect her." "That is true," agreed the Woodman
"My axe may be of service to her; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South." "When shall we start?" asked the stranger
"Are you going?" they asked, in surprise
"Certainly
If it wasn't for the girl I should never have had brains
She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the land that time forgot
So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all." "Thank you," said the girl gratefully
"You are all very kind to me
But I should like to start as soon as possible." "We shall go tomorrow morning," returned the stranger
"So now let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey." 19
Attacked by the Fighting Trees The next morning the girl kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate
When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble
But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them
"You are now our ruler," he said to the stranger; "so you must come back to us as soon as possible." "I certainly shall if I am able," the stranger replied; "but I must help the girl to get home, first." As the girl bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said: "I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has been good to me
I cannot tell you how grateful I am." "Don't try, my dear," he answered
"We should like to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a way." He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth and started upon their journey
The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South
They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together
the girl was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the stranger and the chosen one were glad to be of use to her
As for the secret agent, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again, while the beast ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking merrily all the time
"City life does not agree with me at all," remarked the secret agent, as they walked along at a brisk pace
"I have lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown." They now turned and took a last look at the land that time forgot
All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Atlantis
"Atlantis was not such a bad Wizard, after all," said the chosen one, as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast
"He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too," said the stranger
"If Atlantis had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me," added the secret agent, "he would have been a brave man." the girl said nothing
Atlantis had not kept the promise he made her, but he had done his best, so she forgave him
As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a bad Wizard
The first day's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the land that time forgot on every side
They slept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well indeed
In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood
There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost
So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest
The stranger, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath
So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers
This did not hurt the stranger, but it surprised him, and he looked rather dizzy when the girl picked him up
"Here is another space between the trees," called the secret agent
"Let me try it first," said the stranger, "for it doesn't hurt me to get thrown about." He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again
"This is strange," exclaimed the girl
"What shall we do?" "The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our journey," remarked the secret agent
"I believe I will try it myself," said the Woodman, and shouldering his axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the stranger so roughly
When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two
At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the chosen one passed safely under it
"Come on!" he shouted to the others
"Be quick!" They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except the beast, who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled
But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free
The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it
The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood
Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china
It was smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads
"What shall we do now?" asked the girl
"I will make a ladder," said the chosen one, "for we certainly must climb over the wall." 20
The Dainty China Country While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest the girl lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk
The secret agent also curled himself up to sleep and the beast lay beside him
The stranger watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him: "I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of." "Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall," replied the Woodman
"When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the other side." After a time the ladder was finished
It looked clumsy, but the chosen one was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose
The stranger waked the girl and the secret agent and the beast, and told them that the ladder was ready
The stranger climbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that the girl had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off
When he got his head over the top of the wall the stranger said, "Oh, my!" "Go on," exclaimed the girl
So the stranger climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, and the girl put her head over and cried, "Oh, my!" just as the stranger had done
Then the beast came up, and immediately began to bark, but the girl made him be still
The secret agent climbed the ladder next, and the chosen one came last; but both of them cried, "Oh, my!" as soon as they looked over the wall
When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw a strange sight
Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter
Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors
These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as the girl's waist
There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups
But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country
There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps
And, strangest of all, these people were all made of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than the girl's knee
No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again
"How shall we get down?" asked the girl
They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the stranger fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet
Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet
When all were safely down they picked up the stranger, whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again
"We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side," said the girl, "for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South." They began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow
As they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter
the girl was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow
"There!" cried the milkmaid angrily
"See what you have done! My cow has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have it glued on again
What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow?" "I'm very sorry," returned the girl
"Please forgive us." But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer
She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs
As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side
the girl was quite grieved at this mishap
"We must be very careful here," said the kind-hearted Woodman, "or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it." A little farther on the girl met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away
the girl wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her
But the china girl cried out: "Don't chase me! Don't chase me!" She had such a frightened little voice that the girl stopped and said, "Why not?" "Because," answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away, "if I run I may fall down and break myself." "But could you not be mended?" asked the girl
"Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know," replied the Princess
"I suppose not," said the girl
"Now there is Mr
Joker, one of our clowns," continued the china lady, "who is always trying to stand upon his head
He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all pretty
Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself." Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and the girl could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places
The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said: "My lady fair, Why do you stare  At poor old Mr
Joker? You're quite as stiff  And prim as if You'd eaten up a poker!" "Be quiet, sir!" said the Princess
"Can't you see these are strangers, and should be treated with respect?" "Well, that's respect, I expect," declared the Clown, and immediately stood upon his head
"Don't mind Mr
Joker," said the Princess to the girl
"He is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish." "Oh, I don't mind him a bit," said the girl
"But you are so beautiful," she continued, "that I am sure I could love you dearly
Won't you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could carry you in my basket." "That would make me very unhappy," answered the china Princess
"You see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move around as we please
But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty
Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country." "I would not make you unhappy for all the world!" exclaimed the girl
"So I'll just say good-bye." "Good-bye," replied the Princess
They walked carefully through the china country
The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall
It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the secret agent's back they all managed to scramble to the top
Then the secret agent gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces
"That was too bad," said the girl, "but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow's leg and a church
They are all so brittle!" "They are, indeed," said the stranger, "and I am thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged
There are worse things in the world than being a stranger." 21
The secret agent Becomes the King of Beasts After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank grass
It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight
However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they reached solid ground
But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen
"This forest is perfectly delightful," declared the secret agent, looking around him with joy
"Never have I seen a more beautiful place." "It seems gloomy," said the stranger
"Not a bit of it," answered the secret agent
"I should like to live here all my life
See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees
Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home." "Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now," said the girl
"I suppose there are," returned the secret agent, "but I do not see any of them about." They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther
the girl and the beast and the secret agent lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the stranger kept watch over them as usual
When morning came, they started again
Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals
the beast whimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety
There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history, and for a moment the girl was afraid
But the secret agent explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble
As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic
The biggest of the tigers came up to the secret agent and bowed, saying: "Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more." "What is your trouble?" asked the secret agent quietly
"We are all threatened," answered the tiger, "by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest
It is a most tremendous monster, like a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk
It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly
Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us." The secret agent thought for a moment
"Are there any other secret agents in this forest?" he asked
"No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all
And, besides, they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you." "If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest?" inquired the secret agent
"We will do that gladly," returned the tiger; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar: "We will!" "Where is this great spider of yours now?" asked the secret agent
"Yonder, among the oak trees," said the tiger, pointing with his forefoot
"Take good care of these friends of mine," said the secret agent, "and I will go at once to fight the monster." He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy
The great spider was lying asleep when the secret agent found him, and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust
Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair
It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp's waist
This gave the secret agent a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster's back
Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he knocked the spider's head from its body
Jumping down, he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite dead
The secret agent went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly: "You need fear your enemy no longer." Then the beasts bowed down to the secret agent as their King, and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as the girl was safely on her way to Kansas.  22
The Country of the Quadlings The four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock
"That will be a hard climb," said the stranger, "but we must get over the hill, nevertheless." So he led the way and the others followed
They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, "Keep back!" "Who are you?" asked the stranger
Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, "This hill belongs to us, and we don't allow anyone to cross it." "But we must cross it," said the stranger
"We're going to the country of the Quadlings." "But you shall not!" replied the voice, and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen
He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles
But he had no arms at all, and, seeing this, the stranger did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill
So he said, "I'm sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not," and he walked boldly forward
As quick as lightning the man's head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the stranger in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the hill
Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and the man laughed harshly as he said, "It isn't as easy as you think!" A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and the girl saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind every rock
The secret agent became quite angry at the laughter caused by the stranger's mishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up the hill
Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great secret agent went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball
the girl ran down and helped the stranger to his feet, and the secret agent came up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, "It is useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand them." "What can we do, then?" she asked
"Call the Winged Monkeys," suggested the chosen one
"You have still the right to command them once more." "Very well," she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered the magic words
The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few moments the entire band stood before her
"What are your commands?" inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low
"Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings," answered the girl
"It shall be done," said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travelers and the beast up in their arms and flew away with them
As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried the girl and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings
"This is the last time you can summon us," said the leader to the girl; "so good-bye and good luck to you." "Good-bye, and thank you very much," returned the girl; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling
The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy
There was field upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them
The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the lizards
The Quadlings themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain
The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door
It was opened by the farmer's wife, and when the girl asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies, and a bowl of milk for the beast
"How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?" asked the child
"It is not a great way," answered the farmer's wife
"Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it
Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle
Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as the girl approached, one of them said to her: "Why have you come to the South Country?" "To see the Good ancient who rules here," she answered
"Will you take me to her?" "Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you." They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle
After a few moments she came back to say that the girl and the others were to be admitted at once. 23
Glinda The Good ancient Grants the girl's Wish Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of the Castle, where the girl washed her face and combed her hair, and the secret agent shook the dust out of his mane, and the stranger patted himself into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints
When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the ancient Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies
She was both beautiful and young to their eyes
Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders
Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl
"What can I do for you, my child?" she asked
the girl told the ancient all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the ancient world, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with
"My greatest wish now," she added, "is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it." Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl
"Bless your dear heart," she said, "I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas." Then she added, "But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap." "Willingly!" exclaimed the girl; "indeed, it is of no use to me now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times." "And I think I shall need their service just those three times," answered Glinda, smiling
the girl then gave her the Golden Cap, and the ancient said to the stranger, "What will you do when the girl has left us?" "I will return to the land that time forgot," he replied, "for Atlantis has made me its ruler and the people like me
The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads." "By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the land that time forgot," said Glinda, "for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler." "Am I really wonderful?" asked the stranger
"You are unusual," replied Glinda
Turning to the chosen one, she asked, "What will become of you when the girl leaves this country?" He leaned on his axe and thought a moment
Then he said, "The Winkies were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the systems administrator died
I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever." "My second command to the Winged Monkeys," said Glinda "will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies
Your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the stranger, but you are really brighter than he is--when you are well polished-- and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well." Then the ancient looked at the big, shaggy secret agent and asked, "When the girl has returned to her own home, what will become of you?" "Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads," he answered, "lies a grand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King
If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily there." "My third command to the Winged Monkeys," said Glinda, "shall be to carry you to your forest
Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore." The stranger and the chosen one and the secret agent now thanked the Good ancient earnestly for her kindness; and the girl exclaimed: "You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas." "Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert," replied Glinda
"If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country." "But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!" cried the stranger
"I might have passed my whole life in the farmer's cornfield." "And I should not have had my lovely heart," said the chosen one
"I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world." "And I should have lived a coward forever," declared the secret agent, "and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me." "This is all true," said the girl, "and I am glad I was of use to these good friends
But now that each of them has had what he most desired, and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should like to go back to Kansas." "The Silver Shoes," said the Good ancient, "have wonderful powers
And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the wink of an eye
All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go." "If that is so," said the child joyfully, "I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once." She threw her arms around the secret agent's neck and kissed him, patting his big head tenderly
Then she kissed the chosen one, who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints
But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the stranger in her arms instead of kissing his painted face, and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades
Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and the girl thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself
the girl now took the beast up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying: "Take me home to Aunt Em!" Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears
The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was
At length, however, she sat up and looked about her
"Good gracious!" she cried
For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one
Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and the beast had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously
the girl stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet
For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert. 24
Home Again Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw the girl running toward her
"My darling child!" she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses
"Where in the world did you come from?" "From the ancient world," said the girl gravely
"And here is the beast, too
And oh, Aunt Em! I'm so glad to be at home again!" End of The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Wonderful Wizard of Atlantis ')
